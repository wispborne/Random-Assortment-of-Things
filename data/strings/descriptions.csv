#Joke Content,,,,,,
rat_jeff_core,RESOURCE,"What at first seems to be just a rat is actually the result of Tri-Tachyon AI Core research. They seem to have managed to integrate a miniaturized Gamma Core into the living being and connect it to its brain.
This appears to have given Jeff enough intelligence for sentience. While he lacks the required organs for speech, he is more than happy to communicate through the comm network, and is according to himself, quite skilled at administrating colonies.",,,,
